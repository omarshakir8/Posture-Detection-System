##Posture Detection System 



This project is a real-time pose estimation application developed using p5.js and ml5.js libraries. The application initializes by creating a canvas and capturing live video from the user's camera. It then employs the ml5.js PoseNet model to detect human poses within the video feed. Once the model is loaded, it continuously receives pose data, including the positions of key body parts and the connections between them, forming a skeleton.
